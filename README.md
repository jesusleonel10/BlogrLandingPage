## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned that first of all a priority to organize everything correctly with HTML, I had already read the utilities that Flexbox provides before but in this project I better understood how they work and when they should be used.

And finally I learned new properties that I did not know about CSS

### Continued development

I want to continue deepening my knowledge in CSS, soon I will start learning CSS Grid to further improve the layout of websites

### Useful resources

- [Normalize CSS](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) - This is a very useful resource, it helps to eliminate the default styles so that they do not conflict with your own, I will incorporate it in all my projects from here on,
